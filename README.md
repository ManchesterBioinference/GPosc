# GPosc

Gaussian process for identifying stochastic oscillations in single-cell data

These are the MATLAB files used to create the figures in the paper "Identifying stochastic oscillations in single cell live imaging time series using Gaussian processes"

The package is based on GPML, and the README for the GPML package is included as READMEGPML. The GPML files are zipped into the file "GPML files.zip". These need to be placed into your working MATLAB folder.

Note that it is important to run the file "startup" before using GPML.

The reference for the GPML toolbox is "C Rasmussen and N Hannes. Gaussian processes for machine learning (GPML) toolbox. Journal of Machine Learning Research, 11:3011 3015, 2010."
